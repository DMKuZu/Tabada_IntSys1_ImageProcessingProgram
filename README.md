## Tabada_IntSys1_ImageProcessingProgram
Simple Image Processing Program made using WPF in Visual Studio

after like doing a bit of research, i saw that avalonia ui doesnt have native access to camera

Unlike in Windows where it has CaptureCameraUI or other native features that arent possible in cross-platform UI like Avalonia

SO ang nahitabo, kaning master branch kay nag gamit ug wpf nya ang main branch kay naggamit ug avalonia ui

nigamit ko wpf kay murag ra siya sa .axaml sa avalonia, tho i think i might have created it the wrong way since ang naa lang jud is literally 1 class whahahaa

oh well, pakita ug code-behind with multiple features under 1 class whahahahaha optimize nlanag kapag may time
